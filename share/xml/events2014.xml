    <description>XDC is the annual conference where people working
      on the FOSS graphics stack meet.  Talks cover projects status,
      work-in-progress, proposals for change, and so on.  Like many
      similar conferences, this is a great opportunity for developers
      and users to talk face to face.  For the first time in a long
      time, FreeBSD will be present and give a talk about the status
      of the graphics stack.  The main goal is to re-establish
      communication with upstream, which tends to get Linux-centric
      these days.</description>
