      this is not a strict requirement.  The basic idea is to get
      together with &os; hackers to discuss and work directly on
      issues resolving as many as we can over the long weekend.
      Fixing bugs, writing code, adding features, improving the
      documentation, working on ports, and such are all welcome
      activities at the event.  There is also a sightseeing tour
      planned on the Monday after.</description>
