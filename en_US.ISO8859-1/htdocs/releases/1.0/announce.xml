Newsgroups: comp.os.386bsd.announce<br/>
Subject: FreeBSD 1.0 RELEASE now available<br/>
Date: 1 Nov 1993 16:12:20 -0800
</p>

<p>The first "official" release of FreeBSD 1.0 is now available, no more
greek letters - this is the "production" release.</p>

<p>While a fair number of bugs were also whacked between EPSILON and
RELEASE, the following additional features deserve special mention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A dynamic buffer cache mechanism that automagically grows and shrinks
    as you use the memory for other things.  This should speed up disk
    operations significantly.</li>

  <li>The Linux sound driver for Gravis UltraSound, SoundBlaster, etc. cards.</li>

  <li>Mitsumi CDROM interface and drive.</li>

  <li>Updated install floppies.</li>

  <li>More fail-safe probing of devices on the ISA bus.  This makes it
    much harder for devices to conflict with each other.</li>

  <li>Advance syscons support for XFree86 2.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, please read the release notes.</p>

<p>FreeBSD 1.0 RELEASE may be obtained by ftp on freebsd.cdrom.com, and
on its various mirror sites within a day or so.</p>

<p>Release structure:</p>

significantly bu finding bugs, contributing fixes and just generally
lending moral support.  Thank You!</p>

<p>Also, continuing thanks to Walnut Creek CDROM who's ongoing (and, up
to now, profitless) support has made this all possible.</p>
