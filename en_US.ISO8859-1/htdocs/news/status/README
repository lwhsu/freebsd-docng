Compiling status reports - best practices

Quarterly status reports git repository:
https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-quarterly

E-mail address for report submissions:
quarterly-submissions@FreeBSD.org

0) Timeline
  - The months of January, April, July and October are dedicated to
    putting together the reports submitted during the precedent month.
    This can include waiting for late submissions.
  - portmgr@ entries default to the extended headline, because of the
    overlap between quarterly reports and quarterly ports branches.
  - All entries can have the deadline extended by emailing
    quarterly-submissions@ up until the extended deadline.
  - Quarterly status report publication is done during the same months
    as soon as the report is ready.

  - First Quarter:
      - First call for reports: March 1st
      - 2 weeks left reminder: March 15th

1) Call for reports
  - Send calls to the freebsd-quarterly-calls@ mailing list, to all
    submitters of last quarterly status reports (they may have updates
    or further improvements), and, depending on the season:
      - Various conference organizers:
        - AsiaBSDCon (secretary@asiabsdcon.org) March (First Quarter);
        - BSDCan (info@bsdcan.org) May (Second Quarter);
        - EuroBSDcon September - October (Third-Fourth Quarter).
	  EuroBSDcon as an organization is not interested in writing
	  reports for FreeBSD (at least it was not in October 2019:
	  its reason is that the conference is not FreeBSD specific),
	  so reports about this event should be asked of members of the
	  FreeBSD community that attended it;
      - Google Summer of Code students and their mentors: soc-students@
        and soc-mentors@ (Second and Third Quarter).
  - The easiest way to send calls for quarterly status reports is to use
    the sendcalls perl script in the tools directory of the git
    repository. It can also be used through a cron job, for example:

    0	0	1,15,24	3,6,9,12	*	cd ~/freebsd-quarterly/tools && ./sendcalls -s 'Daniel Ebdrup Jensen'

    If you are indeed using a cron job, please run it on freefall and
    sign it with your name so that it is possible to infer who has
    configured the cronjob, in case something goes wrong.
    The script automatically sends calls to freebsd-quarterly-calls@, last
    quarter submitters and other recipients depending on the season.
  - It may also be worth making a call for reports on the forums as was
    done here:
    https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/call-for-freebsd-2014q4-october-december-status-reports.49812/
  - The Markdown template is at:
    https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-sample.md
  - Reporting howto is at: https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/howto.html.
    It contains a great deal of useful hints for the submitters on how
    to write good reports.  It also helps to forward all the completed
    reports to developers for reference, and point to the latest report
    in the CFR.

2) Building the report:
  - Review and merge pull requests as well as those submitted via email,
    as they come in.
  - For each newly merged report, add its filename to the local Makefile:
    put it in the variable corresponding to the section where you want
    the report to appear. Sort the variables content as you want to sort
    the reports in the corresponding section.
  - While the reports are being updated, other doc-committers (wblock,
    pluknet, and bjk, for example) may review the individual entries and
    propose fixes.
  - Write an introduction in a file named intro.md in the quarterly
    directory.
    It should be usually the last step in the process; a good introduction
    can be only written once all the reports have been collected.
  - theraven may be poked for composing a nice introduction for the
    reports.
    wblock suggests that we ask different people to write introductions to
    add variety.  Different people will bring different viewpoints and
    help keep it fresh.
  - Run "make" or "make all-xml" in the quarter directory. This step
    needs perl as it invokes the md2docbook perl script. Warning:
    md2docbook lacks some features and likely has some bugs. Do not waste
    your time working on it and use manual editing instead: once the
    conversion of the FreeBSD website to Hugo/AsciiDoctor is finished the
    md2docbook script will become obsolete.
  - Copy the generated DocBook draft to
    en_US.ISO8859-1/htdocs/news/status/report-XXXX-YY-XXXX-ZZ.xml,
    add it to the list in en_US.ISO8859-1/htdocs/news/status/Makefile,
    run "make", and review the generated HTML file,
    en_US.ISO8859-1/htdocs/news/status/report-XXXX-YY-XXXX-ZZ.html.
    This step requires that you have installed textproc/docproj on your
    system.
  - Adjust the Markdown source and regenerate until you are happy with
    the result.
  - Some special characters still break with that - noticed when sos@
    submits a report.

3) Committing it:

  - Files to edit and commit:

    The quarterly report itself:
      doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/htdocs/news/status/report-yyyy-mm-yyyy-mm.xml

    Update the next due date on the status report page and
    add a link to the new report below that:
      doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/htdocs/news/status/status.xml

    The news entry for the main website page:
      doc/share/xml/news.xml

    Sample for the news entry (may need to add month):
      <day>
	<name>15</name>
	<event>
	  <title>October-December 2020 Status Report</title>

	<p>The <a
	  href="&enbase;/news/status/report-2020-10-2020-12.html">October to December 2020 Status Report</a>
	  is now available with 42 entries.</p>
	</event>
      </day>

  - After the html version of the report has been built and is online,
    run in the quarter directory "make all-txt" and prettify its output.
    This step requires that you have installed www/lynx and lang/perl5.30
    (or newer) on your system.

    lynx defaults to a width of 80 and will forcibly wrap URLs to fit
    within that size.  The prettification process includes undoing that
    wrapping of URLS, which is made easier by some questions that are
    asked of you during "make all-txt". In some cases lynx will refuse to
    output certain Unicode characters (such as the U+0142 LATIN SMALL
    LETTER L WITH STROKE found in trasz's surname), instead using an ASCII
    transliteration; these should be returned to the UTF-8 form.

  - Send out
    To: announce@
    Subject: FreeBSD Quarterly Status Report - <First> Quarter <year>

    This one must be approved, so find someone (mail postmaster) who can
    do that before starting.

    Send a separate mail:

    To: hackers
    CC: current, stable
    BCC: developers

4) Repeat.
