Abstract

Welcome to the FreeBSD Architecture Handbook. This manual is a _work in progress_ and is the work of many individuals. Many sections do not yet exist and some of those that do exist need to be updated. If you are interested in helping with this project, send email to the {freebsd-doc}.

The latest version of this document is always available from the link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/[FreeBSD World Wide Web server]. It may also be downloaded in a variety of formats and compression options from the https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/doc/[FreeBSD FTP server] or one of the numerous link:{handbook}#mirrors-ftp/[mirror sites].
