[[open-issues]]
== Open Issues

[2020-10-27] A regression in man:ipfw[8] was discovered where packets are not properly forwarded with multiple IP addresses bound to the same interface.

This issue had been corrected in link:https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-20:21.ipfw.asc[FreeBSD-EN-20:21.ipfw].

See link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=250434[PR 250434] for additional details.

[2020-10-27] A regression with man:zfs[8] send/recv was discovered where ZFS snapshots are not properly deleted under certain conditions.

An Errata Notice is planned for 12.2-RELEASE.

See link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=249438[PR 249438] for additional details.

[2020-10-27] A regression was discovered with the FreeBSD/armv7 BEAGLEBONE images where SD card I/O takes an excessive amount of time. As such, there are no BEAGLEBONE images for this release.

[[late-news]]
== Late-Breaking News

[2020-10-27] A very late issue was discovered with the [.filename]#x11/gdm# package included on the amd64 and i386 DVD installer which causes GDM to fail to start properly.

Those installing GNOME as a new installation from the DVD should upgrade [.filename]#x11/gdm# from the upstream man:pkg[8] mirrors after installation.

Those installing GNOME on a new installation from the upstream man:pkg[8] mirrors, or upgrading from a previous FreeBSD release should not experience any issues.

[2020-11-11] Due to slight changes to the ABI and KBI between FreeBSD 12.1 and FreeBSD 12.2, it is important to note that certain third-party kernel modules may need to be rebuilt locally, until FreeBSD 12.1 reaches end of life.

Of note, this includes, but is not limited to, [.filename]#graphics/\*-kmod#, [.filename]#net/*-kmod#, and possibly others that are too extensive to list.
